Matt9:I�m gonna start with scraping coronatime, then having a bit that plays a random message from a user, that might be fun
Matt9:You know what my first thing is gonna be
Matt9:Ye, what I really need is example code to get an idea of the API�s syntax. Just working from such a huge documentation can be information overload
Matt9:Thanks
Matt9:
om:Because theres no tutorial that seems to have all the up to date methods of bot building
om:If you need to you can also always take a look at my beloved campbell�s code https://github.com/terminalScript/campbell2
om:Lmao
Battlepope Resident of Evil:to represent the entire server, a universal face
Battlepope Resident of Evil:I say for the profile pic then we could take a picture of everybody's face, layer it, then amalgamate it into one megapicture
Matt9:I could probably make it in an hour lol
Battlepope Resident of Evil:Hmmmmm
Matt9:this seems important
Matt9:when someone says I'm, it'll say hi blank I'm dad
Matt9:it could react with a flushed emoji
Matt9:when Ellie says "I'll blank your blank
Matt9:when Fan says a message it could say FANUEL
Matt9:basically, I could build a bot to interact with different people
Matt9:that one's for om tomorrow
Matt9:Peak python nesting
Battlepope Resident of Evil:Just memeing
Matt9:
Battlepope Resident of Evil:nah it's fine
Matt9:btw om
Matt9:fine, I'll use a pic of me
Battlepope Resident of Evil:Hmmmmmm
Battlepope Resident of Evil:>using my pic to design a bot made to harass people
Battlepope Resident of Evil:Lmfao
Matt9:it would be really easy
Matt9:to harass people
Matt9:I want to make a coronatime assist bot
Matt9:the bot API is not hard to use, I just needed to figure out the classes
Matt9:ok, that's good enough to call it at 1am
